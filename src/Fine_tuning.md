# CLM Model Tuning

***Authors Note: This was taken from the official documentation, as are some other things. Fine-tuning a model is difficult, but this will give you insight into the commands and navigation to get towards fine-tuning models.***

*Note: This script was adapted from Hugging Face's Transformers/language-modeling code.*

Welcome to the CLM Model Tuning walkthrough. This section will guide you through how to install and use our guide to fine-tune your models. 


# Language model tuning preface

Fine-tuning the library models for language modeling on a text dataset for models like GPT and GPT-2. Causal languages like this are trained or fine-tuned using a causal language modeling (CLM) loss.

In theory, serving a tuned model can increase incentive and earnings on the Bittensor network. However this depends on many factors: the choice of model, the data used for tuning, and (to a lesser extent), the hyperparameters used for tuning itself. This is not a silver bullet that will immediately guarantee higher earnings, but differences will be more pronounced once the Synapse update is released *(time of writing: July 25, 2022).*

In the following examples, we will run on datasets hosted on [Bittensor's IPFS Genesis Dataset](TheDataset.md), on Hugging Face's dataset [hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets), or with your own text files.

For a full list of models that will work with this script, refer to this [link](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=text-generation).

 

## Installation and requirements

This code assumes you have Bittensor already installed on your machine and is meant to be run entirely separately. Some basic linux command line knowledge is assumed, but [this guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) should provide a good starting point to navigate and move around files, directories, etc.

To start, clone this repository: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opentensor/clm_model_tuning 
```

Install the additional packages for this script:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


All of the following commands assume you are working from this folder:

```bash
cd clm_model_tuning
```

## Fine-tuning on Bittensor

By default, this script will fine-tune GPT2 for Bittensor's mountain dataset. Running:

```bash
python3 finetune_using_clm.py
```
will tune gpt2 with Bittensor's dataset and save the output to ``tuned-model``.

To change the model you are tuning to, e.g. distilgpt2, run:

```bash
python3 finetune_using_clm.py model.name=distilgpt2
```
*A full list of models that can be trained by this script are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=text-generation).*

## Fine-tuning on Hugging Face datasets

Any text dataset on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets) should work by default by overriding the ``dataset.name`` and ``dataset.config`` parameters:

```bash
python3 finetune_using_clm.py dataset.name=wikitext dataset.config_name=wikitext-103-v1
```

## Fine-tuning on your own data

If you have a .txt file saved locally, you can override ``dataset.name``:

```bash
python3 finetune_using_clm.py dataset.name=./path/to/your/data.txt
```
*Note if using your own data, you may have many short sentences and the block size may be insufficient for reasonable performance. It's recommended you pass the flag ``dataset.concatenate_raw=true`` to give the model more context when training. This will reduce the number of batches.*


## Configuring training parameters

All configurable parameters are visible and documented in ``conf/config.yaml``. The defaults are chosen for quick training and not tuned; you will need to experiment and adjust these.

Note: The above parameters are the only commands you can override with this script. That is, you may not pass flags you would normally use when running btcli (i.e. ``--neuron.device`` will not work). If there is a flag you wish to modify feel free to submit a feature request.

To view the changeable parameters, open ``conf/config.yaml`` in whatever text editor you prefer, or use ``cat conf/config.yaml`` to view them.

You do not need to edit this file to change the parameters; they may be overridden when you call this script. e.g., if you wish to change the model to ``distilgpt2``, and the output directory to ``distilgpt-tuned``, you would run:

```bash
python3 finetune_using_clm.py model.name=distilgpt2 output_dir=distilgpt-tuned
```
*Note the nested structure in the config, since ``model`` is above ``name`` in ``conf.yaml``, you must override ``model.name`` when invoking the command.*


## Serving custom models on Bittensor

To serve your tuned model on Bittensor, just override ``neuron.model_name`` with the path to your tuned model:

```bash
btcli run ..... --neuron.model_name=/home/{YOUR_USENAME}/clm_model_tuning/tuned-model
```

## Limitations and warnings

Early stopping is not yet supported. Many features are implemented but not thoroughly tested, if you encounter an issue, reach out on discord or (preferably) create an issue on [this github page](https://github.com/opentensor/clm_model_tuning).
