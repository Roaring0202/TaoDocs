Hi, this is a community project supported by members of the Bittensor community.

In collaboration with community members on the Bittensor Network, as well by harnessing my own intellect, I have now begun to give detailed examples of what exactly is going on when we call the various functions of the Bittensor network. 

Along with this, I have included further documentation and instruction on what Linux commands you will want to know, as well as how to navigate through Unix/the basics of what you'll need to know about going forward if you are to build on the Bittensor Network. 

The objective here is to dissect and analyze the knowledge found within Bittensor so that we may educate those who do not know, but in a way that's more translatable to the average person. 

Although it will take much time and effort, Machine Learning is something that is quite enjoyable, and in the docs we also go over the way it is evolving with our Network. 

This is meant to give a blueprint for workflow within the prompting Network, but I have yet to explore things deeply.

Here at TaoEdu, we are all learning. If you would like to band together with us as either a mining expert of validator with a vision of making this intelligence more accessible, then please, contact me. Thank you.
