Hi, this is a community project supported by members of the Bittensor community.

The goal here is create the best source of documentation to set people on the right path with Bittensor. This means we must arm the people with the knowledge of Linux, Python as well as the commands found within this intricate network. It is also important to recognize the roles of validators and miners, and we will go into more explanation on their respective sections. This is an opensource project, just as Bittensor itself is. If you think you can contribute to better documentation, then please hop aboard and contribute to the documentation - somebody will review your changes, surely. 

TaoEdu strives to be an incentivized learning community within the Bittensor Ecosystem where intelligence can grow and this can become a more common knowledge.
