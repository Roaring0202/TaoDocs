# The following is a synposis and in-depth analysis of what this file does. 
###### **this is a lot of analysis to piece together please look through it before posting it to official documents**

### Import Statements

- Import necessary modules and packages including `torch`, `pandas`, `random`, `time`, `uuid`, and others.
- Import bittensor-related classes such as `Endpoint`, `serializer`, and `synapse`.

### Logger Configuration

- Set up the logger for logging purposes.

### Global Prometheus

- Set up Prometheus client with `Summary`, `Counter`, `Histogram`, and `CollectorRegistry`.

### Dendrite Class

- The `Dendrite` class is an implementation of `bittensor.dendrite()` and operates as a torch autograd-friendly operation.
- It accepts a list of `bittensor.endpoints` and a list of `torch` tensors.
- Implements `__init__()`, `__str__()`, `__repr__()`, and `__del__()` methods.
- The `forward()` method is a static method that handles the autograd-friendly forward RPC call to a list of neuron endpoints.

### Dendrite Class (continued)

#### Backward Method

- Implements the `backward()` method as a static and once_differentiable method.
- This internal autograd-friendly Backward RPC call sends gradients to a list of neuron endpoints.
- Takes the following arguments: `ctx`, `unused_code_grads`, `unused_time_grads`, and `*output_grads`.
- Returns a tuple with optional tensors.

#### _forward Method

- Implements the `_forward()` method to forward tensor inputs to a list of neuron endpoints.
- Takes the following arguments: `endpoints`, `synapses`, `inputs`, `timeout`, and `requires_grad`.
- Returns a tuple containing `outputs`, `codes`, and `times`.

#### Prometheus Counters

- Sets up various Prometheus counters to track performance metrics.
- Tracks metrics for success and failure rates, response bytes, response params, and latency.
- Offers additional debugging information with the DEBUG level enabled.

### generate

Generates text using provided `endpoints`, `prompt`, and various other parameters that control the text generation process.

- **endpoints**: The endpoints to send inputs to.
- **prompt**: Tokenized sentences to send on the wire.
- **timeout**: Request timeout (optional).
- Various other parameters related to text generation.

Returns a tuple containing the prompt generations produced by endpoints with corresponding parsed codes and query times.

### text

Forwards text inputs to a list of neuron endpoints and returns logit encodings or timeouts.

- **endpoints**: The endpoints to send inputs to.
- **synapses**: Bittensor synapse objects with arguments.
- **inputs**: Tokenized sentences to send on the wire.
- **timeout**: Request timeout (optional).
- **requires_grad**: If true, the backward pass triggers passing gradients on the wire (optional).

Returns a tuple containing outputs from synapses, return codes per call per synapse, and times per call per synapse.

### text_causal_lm

Forward text inputs to a list of neuron endpoints and returns logit encodings or timeout.

- **endpoints**: Endpoints to send inputs to. Endpoint can be one of the following types:
  - a single endpoint tensor shape [250]
  - a set of endpoint tensors shape [n, 250]
  - a list of endpoints tensors each of shape [250]
  - a single endpoint object. Inputs will be sent to this endpoint alone.
  - a list of endpoint objects. All inputs will be sent to these endpoints.
- **inputs**: Tokenized sentences to send on the wire. Inputs can be one of the following types:
  - a single string: the string will be tokenized using the bittensor tokenizer.
  - a list of strings: the strings will be tokenized using the bittensor tokenizer.
  - a tensor with shape [batch_size, sequence_len], assumed to be the output of bittensor tokenizer.
  - a tensor with shape [n, batch_size, sequence_len], the operation will unbind the tensor and pass inputs to endpoints.
  - a list of tensors of type long each representing a tokenized sentence to be sent to each endpoint.
- **synapse**: Synapse axon function call which defaults to bittensor.synapse.TextCausalLM().
- **timeout**: Request timeout. Queries that do not respond will be replaced by zeros.
- **requires_grad**: If true, the backward pass triggers passing gradients on the wire.

Returns:

- **outputs**: List of output logit encodings of inputs produced by each remote endpoints. Non-responses are zeroes of input shape plus output dimension. The first dimension will match the number of endpoints queried.
- **codes**: dendrite call return ops.
- **times**: times per call.

### text_causal_lm_next

Forward text inputs to a list of neuron endpoints and returns logit encodings or timeout.

  - a single endpoint object. Inputs will be sent to this endpoint alone.
  - a list of endpoint objects. All inputs will be sent to these endpoints.
- **inputs**: Tokenized sentences to send on the wire. Inputs can be one of the following types:
  - a single string: the string will be tokenized using the bittensor tokenizer.
  - a list of strings: the strings will be tokenized using the bittensor tokenizer.
  - a tensor with shape [batch_size, sequence_len], assumed to be the output of bittensor tokenizer.
  - a tensor with shape [n, batch_size, sequence_len], the operation will unbind the tensor and pass inputs to endpoints.
  - a list of tensors of type long each representing a tokenized sentence to be sent to each endpoint.
- **synapse**: Synapse axon function call which defaults to bittensor.synapse.TextCausalLMNext().
- **timeout**: Request timeout. Queries that do not respond will be replaced by zeros.
- **requires_grad**: If true, the backward pass triggers passing gradients on the wire.

Returns:

- **outputs**: List of output topk phrases encodings of inputs produced by each remote endpoints. Non-responses are zeroes of input shape plus output dimension. The first dimension will match the number of endpoints queried.
- **codes**: dendrite call return ops.
- **times**: times per call.

# text_last_hidden_state

The `text_last_hidden_state` function is designed to forward text inputs to a list of neuron endpoints and return the last hidden state responses or time out.

## Arguments

- **endpoints**: The endpoints to send the inputs to. This can be a single endpoint tensor, a set of endpoint tensors, a list of endpoint tensors, a single endpoint object, or a list of endpoint objects.
- **inputs**: The tokenized sentences to send on the wire. This can be a single string, a list of strings, a tensor with a specific shape, or a list of tensors of type long.

- **synapse**: An optional synapse axon function call that defaults to `bittensor.synapse.TextLastHiddenState`.

## Returns
