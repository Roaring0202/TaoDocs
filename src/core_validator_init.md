# __Core Validator .py Analysis__ 
### ___It is important to note here that I have no idea about the accuracy of statements of this, and I couldn't explain what the code actually does. In fact, I didn't. If it seems inaccurate to you, then tell me and I can correct it.___ 


## The code revolves around the following concepts:

> Querying multiple machine learning models (endpoints) and aggregating their predictions.
> Calculating Shapley values and Shapley synergies to evaluate the contributions of each model in a coalition.
> Formatting the predictions and logging results for a better understanding of model performance and interactions.

## The main functions of the code can be summarized as follows:

> query function: Sends queries to multiple endpoints (models), collects their responses, and returns the aggregated results along with endpoint statistics.
> shapley function: Calculates Shapley values based on endpoint statistics and the loss values of each model in a coalition.
> shapley_synergy function: Calculates Shapley synergies for coalitions of size 2, measuring the performance improvement over expected individual model performance.
> format_predictions function: Formats the batch task top-k predictions for a rich table print of query responses.
> unsuccess function: Prints the return codes and response times of unsuccessful responses.

## Overall, the purpose of this Python file is to handle interactions between multiple machine learning models, evaluate their performance and contributions to a coalition, and format the results for better understanding and visualization.
