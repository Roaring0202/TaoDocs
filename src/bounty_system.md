# How does the bounty system work?

It is important to note here that Bounties have been a concept in programming for a long time, and the core of it's philosophy is this: 
## **Do good work, recieve money.** 
Here on the Bittensor Network, it is no different, but the current bounties revolve around training Langauge models generally - there are also community funded endeavors, and those happen on more of an individual basis. With that being said, if you think you can help people with their project, then show you are capable and work may come your way. Or, feel free to submit a formal application towards Bittensors e-mail and put yourself out there. Work cannot find you if you have no projects to showcase your abilities, so start building.
