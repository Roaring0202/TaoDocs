# What are some good base models?

Llama models and their variants such as [Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/lmsys) are also good and this one actually has a template on Runpod.
[Eleuther](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI) models are good. 

***Authors note: If you would like to contribute to this list, please tell me why these models are good and what other models are good for Bittensor miners.***
