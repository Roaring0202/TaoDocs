# Documentation for the Bittensor network

## Local development

### Setup

1. First of all you need to have install cargo in your machine.
2. You have to install `mdbook` using cargo: `cargo install mdbook`

### Build the site

1. `mdbook build`
2. `mdbook serve`
3. Then you will have a local docs site available.


***Important notice***
mdBook will give you a clean interface, but this format is something good for any website going forward. From here, it's just building out the book.TOML file, along with any .js or other code you need. I highly recommend getting familiar with mdBook going forward, it's very nice if you want a better way to take notes.
