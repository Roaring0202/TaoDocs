# Linux_Basics
### __I must note the importance of being comfortable navigating Linux and reading code when it comes to developing on the Bittensor Network. Rust is also a good language for documentation, as it is easy to lose track of all the knowledge acquired. At some point, it will become second nature - you will remember what cat does, what a pipe is(example | grep), and you will understand how to use WSL. Speaking of WSL, you should refer to the "Why WSL" section of the Docs.__
