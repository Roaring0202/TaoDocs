# Synopsis of Bittensor Code

This module will eventually detail the components of Bittensor, a decentralized AI network. Key components include versioning, rich console setup, functions for controlling the console, constants, and Prometheus setup.

## Key Components

- **Versioning**: The code uses semantic versioning with a format like `4.0.1`.
- **Rich Console Setup**: The rich console is set up to display output in a more visually appealing manner.
- **Console Control**: A function `turn_console_off` is provided to turn off the rich console output.
- **Constants**: Various constants are defined, such as network dimensions, block time, SS58 format, dataset names, entry points, and network explorer map.
- **Prometheus Setup**: The code sets up Prometheus for monitoring with a version like `0.1.0`.

## Example Usage

The Bittensor code can be used to create and interact with a decentralized AI network. This includes managing the network components, dataset handling, and communication with the Substrate blockchain.

Please note that the actual implementation details, such as importing required classes and setting up default configurations, have been omitted from this summary for brevity.
