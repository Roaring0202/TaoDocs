# Example Python Script with a prompt.

```
import bittensor as bt

response = bt.prompt('What is your name?')

print(response)
```

**This is just one example of a very simple prompt that gets a response from the Network.**

***The following is some advice/insight into things I've discovered about this Network.***
1. How can I achieve faster responses from my script?
- More TAO = Faster Prompting. Staked TAO on the Validator hosting your particular prompting Network, prompted with your wallet, allows you to earn TAO whilst using it as an API.
- The more you stake, the faster your query.  

2. How can I get TAO?
- [Tensor Exchange](https://tensor.exchange/) is a trading platform for TAO that exchanges BTC for TAO
- You can use BTC or Stripe(card) payments to rent RunPod Servers or other GPU hosting services, Fine tune a model and mine TAO with it.
- Stake your TAO to stack your RAO.  

3. Why is it so complicated?
- If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. It'll get easier over time, and soon we'll see the application side of this technology.
