# Example Python Script with a prompt.

```
import bittensor as bt

response = bt.prompt('What is your name?')

print(response)
```

**This is just one example of a very simple prompt that gets a response from the Network.**

1. Response is slow!! y?! 
- More TAO = Faster Prompting. Staked TAO on the Validator hosting your particular prompting Network, prompted with your wallet, allows you to earn TAO whilst using it as an API. 

2. How can I get TAO?
- Tensor.Exchange
- Find somebody to work for(bounty systems) and get paid in BTC, use it to buy TAO. 
- Use BTC to buy RunPod Servers or other GPU hosting services, Fine tune a model and mine TAO with it. 

3. Why is it so complicated?
- If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. It'll get easier over time.
