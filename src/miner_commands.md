# Miner Template Analysis 

The provided code analysis is of a benchmarking superclass for the Bittensor framework. It measures the performance of miners with respect to query execution, allowing for customization and testing of various parameters.

## Key Components

1. **__init__(self):** Initializes the benchmark background processes and sets up the logging directory.

2. **benchmark_config(cls):** Retrieves the configuration from the argument parser.

3. **add_args(cls, parser):** Adds command-line arguments for configuration.

4. **miner_name():** Returns the miner's name as a string. This method should be implemented in the subclass.

5. **run_neuron(config):** This method should be implemented in the subclass to run the neuron using the provided configuration.

6. **config():** Returns the configuration object for the miner. This method should be implemented in the subclass.

7. **_run_background_process(self, run_neuron_func, config_func):** Initializes the background process by pulling the configuration and starting the subclass static run method.

8. **startup(self):** Starts the mining process in the background.

9. **shutdown(self):** Terminates the mining process.

10. **find_endpoint(self):** Finds the background neuron axon endpoint from the chain.

11. **dend_forward(args):** Handles the dendrite request for the multiprocessing case.

12. **query_sequence(self, ncalls:int, batch_size:int, block_size:int):** Queries the background neuron with the specified parameters.

13. **print_query_analysis(self, history):** Prints the analysis of the query trial.

14. **run_standard_benchmark(self):** Runs the default query sizes for benchmarking.

15. **run(self):** Executes all methods with the `benchmark_` prefix.

## How to use it

To create your own benchmark for your miner, you need to subclass `QueryBenchmark` and implement the `miner_name()`, `run_neuron(config)`, and `config()` methods. Additionally, you can create custom benchmark methods by adding functions with the `benchmark_` prefix. These functions will be automatically executed when the `run()` method is called.

Once you've created your custom benchmark class, you can run the benchmarking script and analyze the performance of your miner with different configurations and parameters.
