# TaoEdu
Commit number two, electric boogaloo.
In this rendition, I sifted through the .py folders found in various files in the bittensor/bittensor/_example_directory - and simplified/gave insight into the networks inner mechanics for people seeking to build on the Network. For now, I think there's a lot of focus on LLMs, but there's some amazing projects out there and the sky is the limit. 
The goal here is to provide a blueprint and I think I'm close to completing such a thing, but unfortunately, I am still translating things.. I am happy to continue working on these past the initial publication, though to continue making things more comprehensive if people suggest a new perspective.

Also, I cloned the current Docs repo. I'm going to use it to make this one look better so you have a better thing. Anyways. I intend on working on this until it's done so I'll be doing this.

# TaoEdu - the .md files are in src
Welcome to the documentation project, where I try to help people get started with Bittensor. 
I'm new to pushing repos, but this is what's currently in my documentation.
I have more than this, but I'm also re-formatting and making sure that the current things look okay. 

Everything should be more put together by tomorrow, and the bulk majority should be done ideally by Monday morning or evening. 

Depends on what ones visions of the docs is, but from an objective overview of commands and functions: If our intent is to educate people how to use Bittensor, the baseline of intelligence required is going to be a lot of computer intelligence most people don't know much about - which I'm happy to make sections on the most commonly used commands when navigating the network. 

I personally use WSL, but I don't think most people would even know where to start with this project. First and foremost, it's basic computer science - so perhaps a goal of Bittensor should be to pursue educating people about how to optimize the way they use their computer, but also, just general python knowledge is invaluable for prompting the network so..

I was even thinking of including examples of Bittensor Python scripts on the prompting network for when things are launched in the future. If you would like to contribute any such scripts, that would be amazing, because I'm not good at programming quite yet.
