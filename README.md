# Important to note - the .md files are in src if you just want those

**These documents were transcribed by TAOBard and although some of the main documentation has been implemented into this mdBook format, I haven't yet studied website creation If you would like to collaborate with me - this is aided in collaboration with other people in the Bittensor community. If you think you could further improve this documentation from the perspective of a teacher or student then please, get in contact as I would enjoy implementing better documentation if members of the community can write such things. I would love the assistance, as we are all learning. This is mainly an AI/Human analysis of the various files found within the Bittensor project itself, as well as how somebody would begin to interact with the Network from step 0(which would be owning a computer). By no means do I claim to be an expert at training ML Models, and I cannot contribute to that conversation yet. That being said, I can give advice for those curious about this obscure technology and teach you if have never touched a Linux terminal before.**

## The Main Purpose of This Documentation:

1. The first point we must speak on the fact that, although designed as a blue-print for decentralized AI, the Network still exists in obscurity. 
    - For one thing, **this whole Network** is way older than people realize. Bittensor has been around the block in the AI world, and these people that are building the Network work around the clock to develop the documentation, the functions and the over-all security of this Network. 

#### So if it's so obscure, why should we adopt it?

1. Bittensor essentially forces you to learn about computer science, which is an increasingly in-demand field that people are paying good money for. From engineering prompts to building out a secure Network database, Bittensor utilizes a foundational skill-set that any computer scientist should be familiar with. 
2. Along with this, apps are being developed on the Network, and there is now an API. The Prompting Network is accessible through Python scripts!
