Commit number two, electric boogaloo.
In this rendition, I sifted through the .py folders found in various files in the bittensor/bittensor/_example_directory - and simplified/gave insight into the networks inner mechanics for people seeking to build on the Network. For now, I think there's a lot of focus on LLMs, but there's some amazing projects out there and the sky is the limit. 
The goal here is to provide a blueprint and I think I'm close to completing such a thing, but unfortunately, I am still translating things.. I am happy to continue working on these past the initial publication, though to continue making things more comprehensive if people suggest a new perspective.

Also, I cloned the current Docs repo. I'm going to use it to make this one look better so you have a better thing. Anyways. I intend on working on this until it's done so I'll be doing this.
